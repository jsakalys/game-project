sort it! Seattle

This game is a fun single-player game where the player must "race the clock" to sort all of the rubbish into the proper bin before the garbage collector arrives. It features a tutorial mode that color-codes rubbish items to help the player learn the difference between compostables, recycling, and garbage.

The script takes advantage of jQuery and jQuery UI's draggable and droppable features, as well as the Sweet Alert script by Tristan Edwards. Vector graphics are courtesy of Vecteezy.com.
